/**
 * Deptrac prints "Syntax Error on File <path>" for a file it cannot parse, drops that
 * file from the dependency graph, then reports Errors 0 and exits 0 — a clean run that
 * never actually checked the file. There is no machine-readable signal for this failure
 * mode: Deptrac's JsonOutputFormatter::finish() has no code path for an unparseable
 * file, so a guard built on `--formatter=json` would never see it. This is why the
 * "deptrac" composer script (see composer.json) greps Deptrac's console text for
 * "Syntax Error" instead. Do NOT rewrite the guard or this test to use
 * --formatter=json — that would silently disarm the check requirement 333 exists to
 * enforce, for the sake of a "cleaner" machine-readable channel that does not carry
 * this signal.
 *
 * This test shells out to the real `composer deptrac` script against the real src/
 * tree (not a stub or a fixture config) so that a future Deptrac release rewording its
 * message would be caught here too. A fixture-config test would bypass the composer
 * script entirely and could never catch that.
